# iRacing UI VoiceAttack Profile
VoiceAttack profile that contains a number of voice commands to navigate the iRacing Beta UI

Welcome Sim Racers to the alpha release my VoiceAttack profile for iRacing Beta UI.

This VoiceAttack profile contains a number of voice commands that I use to quickly navigate the iRacing Beta UI. 

It's very useful to me because I don't like to use the keyboard and mouse while I'm in VR.

I'll link to a video where I demo an older version of these VoiceAttack commands.
